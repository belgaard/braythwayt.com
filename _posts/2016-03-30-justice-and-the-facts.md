*WARNING: Unfinished!!!*

About once a year I encounter some variation on this question: “Is it racist to believe and/or discuss facts about the performance of blacks versus whites on standardized tests?" A related question is, "Is it racist to point out the disparity between conviction and arrest statistics between blacks and whites?" Both engender a lot of discussion.

The short--and incomplete--answer is, *It not ncessesarily racist to discuss facts*.

The proper follow-up is, *It is racist to use statistics--whether true or false--to socially engineer injustice.*

### "justice is, at its core, equal treatment for all"

The second statement is really the crux of the matter. The moral issue is not actually about facts or race, it's about **justice**.

Justice is, at its core, equal treatment for all. Justice is not imposing consequences on individuals based on statistical evidence about classes to which they belong. For example, let us consider crime:

When a woman is murdered, it’s nearly always a male partner who has done it. If we find a woman murdered in her home, it would be a tremendous savings of time and money if we just locked their male partner up on the spot, and we’d nearly always be right. We don't need the actual statistics on hand. For the sake of argument's say that out of every ten women who have male partners, who are murdered in their homes, their partner is guilty nine times. Only one of those ten male partners is innocent.

So if there are 100 women murdered, and we lock up 100 men, just lock 'em up, we're right 90% of the time, and we do away with a lot of pesky trials and nonsense about whether evidence is the fruit of the poisoned tree, and haranguing tech companies to unlock their phoines so we can see if they plotted with another lover to collect on the insurance money. But every tenth time, an innocent man goes to jail, and we decided a long time ago--correctly, in my opinion--that this is a terrible thing to lock up innocent people 10% of the time just to save ourselves a lot of trouble.

Those ten innocent men in jail are an injustice.

So we have this system where we investigate the crimes, and the outcomes might be that for those ten innocent men, for eight of the cases we didn't charge them at all. And in teh ninth case, we charged him but he was found innocent in court, and in the tenth case, we convicted an innocent man. And that one innocent man in jail is still a terrible thing, but we think that's better than ten innocent men in jail.

Now what about the 90 men who did it? Well, the sword of justice cuts both ways. Because of the expense and aggravation of a trial, for ten cases the prosecutors cut a plea bargain with them, and they got a reduced sentence for manslaughter or something. In six cases they went to trial and for one reason or another they were declared innocent. And most egregiously, in three cases no charges were brought at all because of some slip-up like improper handling of evidence, or obtaining a confession without informing them of their rights.

So because of our sense of justice and busy courts and smart lawyers, of the 90 people we know did it, nineteen of them really don't get the full "punishment," and so if you are a completely amoral person, you might think that this is terrible, because if you lock them all up, you're wrong 10% of the time, but if you investigate everyone, you're wrong 20% of the time.

Justice is the idea that we'd much rather be wrong about guilty people than be wrong about innocent people.

### "when we as a society value justice, we willingly pay the cost for it"

I can't tell you whether to value justice personally, all I can do is explain how it works, and explain that when we as a society value justice, we willingly pay the cost for it. Those nineteen guilty men who got reduced or no sentences are the cost we pay for having just one wrongly convicted man instead of ten. All of the things we value in society have some cost, to us personally, to society as a whole, or both.[^value]

[^value]: Now, I can't tell you whether to personally value justice. Not everybody does. And if you don't, I disagree, but I understand. What I'm going to do is explain why racism is unjust. I'm going to say that racism is incompatible with justice. And some people will sincerely think, "so what?" I'm not going to try to explain why justice matters *and* explain why racism is unjust. I'm going to explain why racism is unjust, and you will need to read another essay to sort out why justice is valuable.

Now to "facts" about race and intelligence, or crime, or anything else. Let's make up another scenario, one less violent. I will over-simplify. We go to various universities, and we count the number of people of each colour, and figure out how many people of each colour graduate with a degree in CS. The statistics work out to:

| Colour | %age of CS graduates |
|:-------|---------------------:|
| Black  | 10%                  |
| White  | 40%                  |
| Yellow | 80%                  |

(I have no idea how to measure "whiteness," "blackness," or the awful term "yellowness," but we're talking about racism, so we have to put ourselves into racist shoes.)

Now we run a company, and we want to hire CS grads[^degree], so we go to a job fair at the school. And what we do is, we set up a booth and we talk to people about jobs at our company, and we take résumés. Now here's the thing, we can only talk to so many people per hour, and there are more students than we can handle, so if we don't care about justice, what we can do is this:

[^degree]: Which in and of itself betrays some problems with justice, but we'll leave that for another day.

0. If there's a yellow person waiting to talk to someone, talk to them.
0. If there's no yellow person waiting to talk to someone, talk to a white person.
0. Don't talk to black people at all, because you might be busy when a yellow or white person comes by.

Why do we have this strategy? Because we only want to talk to CS graduates, and this seems to be the easiest way to maximize the number of CS graduates we speak to. Of course, this is ridiculous! What we can actually do is, *ask each person if they're a CS graduate*.

But once again, the idea of justice is that even if we were right 99 times out of 100, that 100th time when we locked up the wrong man is abhorrent to us, so we gather evidence and conduct a trial 100 times, so that we can give that 1/100th man a chance to show that he is innocent.

And this is what it comes down to, every time. The opposite of racism (and a bunch of other -isms) isn’t the belief that all persons are equally capable, but that all persons have an equal right to justice and opportunity. That we give them a hearing and judge them on their personal merits regardless of what the statistics say about a large group.
