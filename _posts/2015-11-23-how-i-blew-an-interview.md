### background: the interview

Some time ago, I was a development manager with 23 reports spread over four teams. When I joined my current company, they had already made the transition from "smart people in a room" to having a repeatable process. And they had been able to grow from a pair of Waterloo graduates to about forty engineers, half of whom were in my group.

After a series of embarassing schedule SNAFUs, my company had doubled down on process, instituting rigid Big Design Up Front and scheduling weekly reviews of the uniquitous waterfall GANTT charts. This had helped, but the schedule kept slipping. I had joined to lead a small team, and I brought a different tool, Agile, to the table. After my small team had hit several targets in a row, I was promoted to manage four teams, and with the new approach, the group hit its ship date for the very first time.

I was well-regarded within the company, and happy. However, a friend worked for a startup with excellent prospects, and he convinced me that I ought to fly down to Curpertino and interview for the VP of Engineering role. They were growing like crazy, and needed to go beyond "a bunch of smart people in a room." I'd be the most senior non-founder, and it would mean a chance to build the engineering organization.

I packed my discs and cleats[^apple-tandem], and flew down for a day of meetings. The technical interviews went extremely well. I wowed them by using the `explicit` keyword in a C++ coding test, I cracked a few logic puzzles, I found some cycles in some graphs, and otherwise waved the signal that I was a good cultural fit for the technical norms of the time.

[^apple-tandem]: There used to be a regular lunchtime game of pickup Ultimate at the Cupertino library. it was informally known as the "Apple-Tandem" game, presumably because it was founded by engineers from those respective companies. That being said, I never actually met anyone who professed to be from Apple or Tandem.

I also met with the founders, and we were joined by a representative from the lead investor. After some talk about my background, we turned to the subject of engineering process and culture, my chance to display the value I could bring them. I was enthusiastic and confident as I expounded on my theories about iterative development, the problems with the "glass case plan" anti-pattern, the ways in which software architecture could remove the dependencies that made waterfall process seem necessary, and much more.

When the interviews concluded, I was certain that I had demonstrated why I was the ideal candidate for the role. I had the experience, the knowledge, and the track record to demonstrate my value. Not to mention my friend pulling for me. Unfortunately, I did not get an offer. Instead, I received a polite "thank you, but no thank you" letter.

### the feedback

I contacted my friend. What went wrong? He sighed.

"The founders thought you were too theoretical. They got the sense you would be a great coach or evangelist, but lacked the hands-on attitude they were looking for to actually build a team up." I was astounded. Hadn't I written a metric fuck-ton of code at my current company? Didn't I run multiple development meetings, train tech leads on the process, and do an anormous amount of reporting and prediction? Wasn't I working with burn-downs, buffer delats, and other metrics every day?
