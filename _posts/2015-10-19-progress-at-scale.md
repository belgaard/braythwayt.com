### overcoming adversity

Leonard, Gwen, and Reginald all overcame systemic colour and class discrimination to become successful in their chosen fields. They did not listen to naysayers who said they couldn't achieve in life. From their example, we can draw the conclusion that it *is* possible to be a success regardless of the colour of your skin or your gender. From examples like [Jodie Foster][5] and [Tim Cook][4], we conclude that the same is true of sexual orientation.

There are probably excellent examples of overcoming adverse systemic bias for other marginal groups. It seems to be the case taht if you want to succeed, the very best strategy is to set about being successful, not to allow discrimination and systemic bias to intimidate you into not even trying.

However.

That may be true of a single person, but it may not be true of a group of people, or a society, or a country, or humankind. The best strategy for an individual often is at odds with the best strategy for a group. A few minutes thinking about games like [The Prisoner's Dilemma] underscores this basic conundrum.
