Last month, I had the honour of returning to [Nordic Ruby](http://www.nordicruby.org), where I gave a talk about "Optimism" ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/raganwald/optimism), [source](https://github.com/raganwald/presentations/blob/master/optimism.md)):

Nordic Ruby is a unique event. It is very much focused on the conference, not the talks. One of the organizers, CJ Kihlbom, claims that the talks are not the point, they exist as a catalyst for conversations, and it's the conversations that are the true value for attendees.

One of the most interesting follow-up conversations was about the relationship between Learned Optimism's Explanatory Theory and the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset Theory.

Or to put it another way, "Is Learned Optimism Considered Harmful?"

### Learned Optimism[^optimism]

[^optimism]: This may seem [familiar](http://braythwayt.com/homoiconic/2009/05/01/optimism.html)!

Dr. Martin Seligman wrote a book called "[Learned Optimism](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078393?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400078393 "Amazon.com: Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life: Martin E. P. Seligman: Books").[^simplify]

[^simplify]: I am going to simplify it down to a few points, but you should not judge a book solely by whether you like what I said about it. Read it for yourself and decide.

Dr. Seligman did some research on optimism and success. I want to emphasize the word **research**, because the plural of anecdote is not data. No matter how many nice people like me tell you something from our experience, it is not the same thing as what Dr. Seligman does to come up with this stuff.

Dr. Seligman's theory is all about how people explain things to themselves: We have patterns for our explanations, and that by testing our explanations, we can come up with a prediction for our behaviour.

Dr. Seligman gives us a test, he computes a number with the result, and he calls the resulting scalar "optimism," and he claims that people with high optimism are more successful and happier and whatever else that is nice than people with low optimism. And he thinks he has the numbers to prove it.

How does this test work? Dr. Seligman explains that when we make up an explanation for things, we have three fairly binary properties or axes of each explanation.

0. First, we decide something is *personal or impersonal*. Did this thing happen because of me? Or was it something external to me, like another person, or forces of the universe?
0. The second axis or binary property is *general vs. specific*. Is this thing affecting my whole life? Or is it just one very specific aspect of my experience?
0. The final axis is temporal. Are we explaining something as being *permanent*? Of having a lasting effect? Or do we explain it as being *temporary*? Of being a one-off?

When we explain something in our heads, our explanations have three properties that matter to whether we are optimistic or not: Whether we explain things in a personal or impersonal way, whether we explain things in a specific or general way, and whether we explain things in a permanent or temporary way.

### Pessimism and Optimism

Most people intuitively expect to be consistent: Some tend to explain everything as being personal, some tend to explain everything as being impersonal. Some explain thing in a general way, some explain things in specifics. Some see permanent patterns in everything, some see things as a succession of individual, independent events.

Dr. Seligman's insight was that while this is true for many people, some people are asymmetric in an important way: They explain bad events in their lives as being personal, general, and permanent. While they explain good events as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

Dr. Seligman calls such people *pessimists*.

Dr. Seligman's also identifies another group of people who have the opposite and equally important asymmetry: They explain good events in their lives as being personal, general, and permanent. And they explain bad events as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

And Dr. Seligman calls such people *optimists*.


And the test revealed something else. Had someone told me I scored a particularly athletic goal in Ultimate, I would have put it down to my opponent being out of shape, explained that I really focus on being a good ultimate player who specializes in receiving goals, and remembered that on the play before I had run in one direction while my team mate threw the disk in the other, so it was just a one-off. I would have explained the compliment as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

See the asymmetry? This surprised me, I was not consistent. I didn't always explain things one way or the other. More interestingly, I was consistently inconsistent: I explained *bad things* as being personal, general, and permanent, but I explained away the good things as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

This may not seem rational. Logically, each of us ought to be consistent in how we explain the world. But we aren't, or at least some of us aren't.

The moment this was revealed to me I could guess what came next. I was a *pessimist*. No kidding, according to me all the bad things in my life were everywhere, they followed me around because they were about me, and they lasted forever, while the good things were all about other people, and they only came into my life for short moments.

Do I need to explain that optimists are the opposite, cheerfully inconsistent? That's what Dr. Seligman discovered. Like the pessimists, optimists do not always explain the world the same way. But to an optimist, someone not liking andand is simply one person (impersonal, specific) not liking that one thing (specific again), for their own reasons (impersonal), and it was just a few words in the middle of a long day (extremely temporary). And to the optimist, they're a good athlete (personal, general) and have been all their life (permanent). That one goal was just another scene in their long-playing movie of game highlights.

Optimists explain good things as being personal, general, and permanent, and explain away bad things as being impersonal, specific, and temporary. And if you point out the contradiction in their explanations, they see no contradiction. To them, the bad stuff really isn't about them, it's just that one thing that one time.

The book shocked me, I read it a bunch of times and actually bought copies for other people. Besides myself, I knew lots of people who fit Dr. Seligman's pessimist theory, I knew this because they cried on my shoulder about their long-running, personal flaws that affected every part of their lives. They were personal, general, and permanent on the subject of unhappiness. And on the subject of happiness, they were impersonal, specific, and temporary.

So there you have it. One predictor of success is this characteristic Dr. Seligman calls optimism, which he measures by testing whether you explain good or bad events as being personal, general, and permanent.
