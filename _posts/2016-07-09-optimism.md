Last month, I had the honour of returning to [Nordic Ruby](http://www.nordicruby.org), where I gave a talk about "Optimism" ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/raganwald/optimism), [source](https://github.com/raganwald/presentations/blob/master/optimism.md)):

Nordic Ruby is a unique event. It is very much focused on the conference, not the talks. One of the organizers, CJ Kihlbom, claims that the talks are not the point, they exist as a catalyst for conversations, and it's the conversations that are the true value for attendees.

One of the most interesting follow-up conversations was about the relationship between Learned Optimism's Explanatory Theory and the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset Theory.

Or to put it another way, "Is Learned Optimism Considered Harmful?"

### Learned Optimism[^optimism]

[^optimism]: This may seem [familiar](http://braythwayt.com/homoiconic/2009/05/01/optimism.html)!

Dr. Martin Seligman wrote a book called "[Learned Optimism](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078393?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400078393 "Amazon.com: Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life: Martin E. P. Seligman: Books").[^simplify]

[^simplify]: I am going to simplify it down to a few points, but you should not judge a book solely by whether you like what I said about it. Read it for yourself and decide.

Dr. Seligman did some research on optimism and success. I want to emphasize the word **research**, because the plural of anecdote is not data. No matter how many nice people like me tell you something from our experience, it is not the same thing as what Dr. Seligman does to come up with this stuff.

Dr. Seligman's theory is all about how people explain things to themselves: We have patterns for our explanations, and that by testing our explanations, we can come up with a prediction for our behaviour.

Dr. Seligman gives us a test, he computes a number with the result, and he calls the resulting scalar "optimism," and he claims that people with high optimism are more successful and happier and whatever else that is nice than people with low optimism. And he thinks he has the numbers to prove it.

How does this test work? Dr. Seligman explains that when we make up an explanation for things, we have three fairly binary properties or axes of each explanation.

0. First, we decide something is *personal or impersonal*. Did this thing happen because of me? Or was it something external to me, like another person, or forces of the universe?
0. The second axis or binary property is *general vs. specific*. Is this thing affecting my whole life? Or is it just one very specific aspect of my experience?
0. The final axis is temporal. Are we explaining something as being *permanent*? Of having a lasting effect? Or do we explain it as being *temporary*? Of being a one-off?

When we explain something in our heads, our explanations have three properties that matter to whether we are optimistic or not: Whether we explain things in a personal or impersonal way, whether we explain things in a specific or general way, and whether we explain things in a permanent or temporary way.

### Pessimism and Optimism

Most people are consistent: Some tend to explain everything as being personal, some tend to explain everything as being impersonal. Some explain thing in a general way, some explain things in specifics. Some see permanent patterns in everything, some see things as a succession of individual, independent events.

Dr. Seligman's insight was that while this is true for many people, some people are asymmetric in an important way: They explain bad events in their lives as being personal, general, and permanent. While they explain good events as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

Dr. Seligman calls such people *pessimists*.

Dr. Seligman's also identifies another group of people who have the opposite and equally important asymmetry: They explain good events in their lives as being personal, general, and permanent. And they explain bad events as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

And Dr. Seligman calls such people *optimists*.

According to pessimists, all the bad things in their lives are everywhere, they follow pessimists around because they flow from the pessimists themselves. They last forever: The pessimist has always had these bad things happen, and always will. And they are about big, general things in the pessimist's life. Every small bad thing is just evidence of a greater problem.

Meanwhile, the good things that happen to pessimists are fleeting, they are narrow and specific, and reflect other people and other things, not the pessimists themselves. Pessimists underperform their potential, because they have no belief that they have any power to make good things happen, just bad things. Pessimists tend towards feeling *helpless*.[^helpless]

[^helpless]: Dr. Seligman is also responsible for groundbreaking (and controversial) research on Learned Helplessness.

Optimists explain good things as being personal, general, and permanent, and explain away bad things as being impersonal, specific, and temporary. They believe that they are responsible for the good things in their lives. That the god things are general, that each good event is evidence of a bigger positive phenomena, and that it is part of a long-running story. But the bad things are external, very specific, and happened just that one time.

Optimists operate with confidence that they can make good things happen, and this confidence flows from their asymmetrical way of explaining events to themselves.
