One of the big questions to answer before starting any programming application is, *Should we use a framework?* It's an important question, and I won't attempt to answer it here. But I do wish to refute an argument I often hear in favour of frameworks, namely: "If you don't explicitly choose an existing framework, you will end up with your own proprietary in-house framework." Or as nerds of a certain age might joke:

> Every sufficiently complicated in-house application contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a framework.

Having your own ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a framework is certainly not something to be fervently desired in most cases, but I'd like to explain why I don't feel this argument lines up with my experience.
